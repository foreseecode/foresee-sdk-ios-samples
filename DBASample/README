This sample project demonstrates an implementation of the Verint DBA module in an empty iPhone app.

Features:

* Start Verint SDK using local configuration
* Start and stop recording using DBA SDK API
* Mask and unmask view using DBA SDK API
* Debug masking

The recorded session will be available on CxSuite after some time (~1 hour) required for processing video and other session data.
