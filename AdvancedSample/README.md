This sample project demonstrates a more advanced implementation of the Verint's Survey Managment features.

Features:

* A Survey Management survey triggered by a "significant event" count and a "page views". The user will become eligible to receive an invitation once a configured thresholds are met. See configuration file to check the thresholds.
* A Survey Management survey triggered by a "name". Survey will be presented each time, ignoring the configured criteria thresholds (viz. without checking the eligibility).
* The "significant event" count can be incremented using a button in the app.
* An in-line custom invite. Custom invite triggered by a "significant event" count and a "page views". See configuration file to check the thresholds.
* Localisation of invites/survey. This app supports invite text overrides for Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese and can show surveys in English, French, and Spanish. Change your device's language setting to view invites/surveys in another language.
