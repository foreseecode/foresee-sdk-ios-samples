This sample project demonstrates a more advanced implementation of the ForeSee trigger code in an empty iPhone app.

Features:

* A ForeSee measure survey triggered by a "significant event" count, which can be incremented using a button in the app. The user will 
become eligibile to receive and invitation once a configured threshold is met.
* A ForeSee Feedback survey 
* Localization of invites/survey. This app supports invite text overrides for Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese and can show surveys in English, French, and Spanish. 
Change your device's language setting to view invites/surveys in another language.
