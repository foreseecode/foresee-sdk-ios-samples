Internationalization Demo

This sample project demonstrates how you can customize the default Invite View (FSInviteView) with text of your
choosing.  It also demonstrates how you can localize the invitation text using standard localization techniques
for iOS.  The demo app supports English, French, and Spanish.  Simply change the language setting of the test device
to see the invite in another language.

All strings used by the FSInviteView class are defined in the Localizable.strings file.
