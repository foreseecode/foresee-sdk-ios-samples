/**
The ForeSeeCxMeasure class provides the main interface to the ForeSee CxMeasure module. You must add a
`foresee_configuration.json` file to your project that defines the behavior of the Trigger module (e.g. defines the
triggering criteria for inviting a user to participate in a survey).

#### Configuration
Most configuration is done through the `foresee_configuration.json` file. Behavior such as trigger criteria,
invitation modes, repeat days, are done through the configuration file. If you want to customize runtime behavior
e.g. displaying custom invitations, you can provide a delegate with the setInviteDelegate: method.

#### Debugging
When testing your configuration, it is recommended you enable debug log mode. Useful information regarding internal
state will be posted to the console for inspection.

#### Notifications
The CxMeasure module will post a number of notifications to the default `NSNotificationCenter`:

- `FSInviteDidShowNotification` ( Posted when the default invitation was displayed. )
- `FSInviteWasDeclinedNotification` ( Posted when the default invitation was declined. )
- `FSInviteWasAcceptedNotification` ( Posted when the default invitation was accepted. )
- `FSSurveyWasCompletedNotification` ( Posted when the survey was completed. )
- `FSSurveyWasAbandonedNotification` ( Posted when the survey was abandoned. )
- `FSSurveyDidShowNotification` ( Posted when the survey was presented. )
