## Projects
All projects can be found in `ForeSeeSamples.xcworkspace`. Information about running each project follows.
## AdvancedSample
This sample project demonstrates a more advanced implementation of the ForeSee trigger code in an empty iPhone app.

Features:

* A ForeSee measure survey triggered by a "significant event" count, which can be incremented using a button in the app. The user will 
become eligibile to receive and invitation once a configured threshold is met.
* A ForeSee Feedback survey 
* Localization of invites/survey. This app supports invite text overrides for Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese and can show surveys in English, French, and Spanish. 
Change your device's language setting to view invites/surveys in another language.



## BasicSample
This sample project demonstrates a basic implementation of the ForeSee trigger code in an empty iPhone app.
It uses the provided FSInviteView to show a modal dialog to the user inviting them to take a survey when
they have met the configured threshold.

## BasicSwiftSample
This sample project demonstrates a basic Swift implementation of the ForeSee trigger code. It uses a bridging header to include the SDK.

## ContactInvitationSample
This example shows how to provide a user's contact information to the SDK for use in a CONTACT mode survey.


## CustomInvitationSample
This example demonstrates the use of a custom invite handler.


## FeedbackSample
This sample project demonstrates a Swift implementation of the ForeSee Feedback Survey code and configuration. 


## LocalNotificationSample
This sample project demonstrates a local notification invite. Accept the invite and then close the application. 
You will receive a local notification linking the survey.
