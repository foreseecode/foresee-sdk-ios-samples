## Installation
This project requires [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). After cloning, run:

    pod install

## Projects
All projects can be found in `VerintSamples.xcworkspace`. Instructions for running each app can be found below. (This text is autogenerated from the `README.md` files within each project.)

## AdvancedSample
This sample project demonstrates a more advanced implementation of the Verint's Survey Managment features.

Features:

* A Survey Management survey triggered by a "significant event" count and a "page views". The user will become eligible to receive an invitation once a configured thresholds are met. See configuration file to check the thresholds.
* A Survey Management survey triggered by a "name". Survey will be presented each time, ignoring the configured criteria thresholds (viz. without checking the eligibility).
* The "significant event" count can be incremented using a button in the app.
* An in-line custom invite. Custom invite triggered by a "significant event" count and a "page views". See configuration file to check the thresholds.
* Localisation of invites/survey. This app supports invite text overrides for Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese and can show surveys in English, French, and Spanish. Change your device's language setting to view invites/surveys in another language.

## BasicSample
This sample project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Verint Predictive code in an empty iPhone app.
It uses the provided EXPInviteView to show a modal dialog to the user inviting them to take a survey when
they have met the configured threshold.

## BasicSwiftSample
This sample project demonstrates a basic Swift implementation of the Verint Predictive code. It uses a bridging header to include the SDK.

## ContactInvitationSample
This example shows how to provide a user's contact information to the SDK for use in a CONTACT mode survey.

## CustomInvitationSample
This example demonstrates the use of a custom invite handler.

## DBASample
This sample project demonstrates an implementation of the Verint DBA module in an empty iPhone app.

Features:

* Start Verint SDK using Verint-hosted remote configuration
* Start and stop recording using DBA SDK API
* Mask and unmask view using DBA SDK API
* Debug masking

## LocalNotificationSample
This sample project demonstrates a local notification invite. Accept the invite and then close the application. 
You will receive a local notification linking the survey.
